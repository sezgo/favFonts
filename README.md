Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - Favorite Fonts

This project is completed with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Structure

-Header with minor navigation
-Nav with major navigation
-Search section for search and adjustment purposes
-Main section to contain the font cards
-Font cards which display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text and an add button
-Footer section with my developer information
-A back-to-top anchor implemented at the right bottom corner

Style
-Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
-Buttons/links should are evident (the cursor changes, etc.)
-overflow from the sample text is hanled via implementation of scroll bar to sample text container

Functionality

-Text typed into the custom text (type something) box immediately changes the sample text displayed in each font card
-The sample text returns to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
- Font size chooser has at least four sizes and immediately changes the sample text font size in each font card
- Implemented clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it makes the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (page is not actually reloaded)


Extras
-Implemented change display icon so you can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
-Implemented the code for toggle theme buttons
